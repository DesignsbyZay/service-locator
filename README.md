# Service Locator

The service locator app is a multilayer map, intended for deployment as both a web application and a Cordova-based mobile application. It presents a hierarchical list of categories of services (education, health care, transportation, etc.) and allows the user to select or deselect various layers. Selected layers are displayed on a Google Maps-based map, with detailed information available by clicking on the map icon.
