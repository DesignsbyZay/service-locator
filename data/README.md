### Proposed format for service locator configuration ###

This file will contain the hierarchical data required to display the different
layers within the service locator application. It is intended to support N levels
of data, with each level being selectable.

Possible values for type include: category, points, shape, polyline, heatmap, ...?

The "name_resource" field is intended for i18n purposes, with the "name" field being the English-language default text.
