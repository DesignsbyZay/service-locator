# Sandbox application #

This web page is intended for use as a testing and prototyping tool, initially for CodeAcross on 2016-03-06 in Redwood City. 
Its initial goal is to load a hierarchical list of categories from a JSON file, present them as a tree view with selectable
layers, and load a list of map points (or display them on a map) in the right-hand panel.

In order for this page to work properly, you will need to create a 'data' directory and place the datasources.json file
from this project in that directory.
